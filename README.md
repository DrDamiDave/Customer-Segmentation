# Customer-Segmentation-and-Analytics

## Background
Expedia Group has seen huge growth in the number of hotel bookings made on Mobile devices (Smartphones and Tablets) over the past few years. 
In order to fully exploit the opportunities in Mobile, we need to understand how customers are using Mobile devices, to help us to:
- Tailor the app and mobile website to the needs of our customers
- Ensure that we have the best selection of hotels available for Mobile users
- Target our marketing efforts appropriately
- 
##Task
You will find an Excel document attached to your email titled “Dataset (Data Science- Analytics).”  In the 'Data' tab you will find a dataset containing order volumes and USD booking values for hotel bookings (both Mobile and Desktop) in November 2017 (and 2016 for comparison). Please make a note of, and/or resolve for, any data quality issues that you encounter. Further information about the data is provided in the ‘further details’ section below. 
We would like you to analyse the data in the Excel spreadsheet and create a 15- minute presentation and a file containing your workings. Please consider: 
•	What does the data suggest regarding how bookings differ by platform and region?
•	Where are we seeing the most growth? 
•	Please use any other measures that you think will be insightful. 
•	What other data or information would you request to gain additional insight?
