# Customer-Segmentation-and-Analytics

## Background
A hotel booking platform has seen huge growth in the number of hotel bookings made on Mobile devices (Smartphones and Tablets) over the past few years. 
In order to fully exploit the opportunities in Mobile, we need to understand how customers are using Mobile devices, to help us to:
- Tailor the app and mobile website to the needs of our customers
- Ensure that we have the best selection of hotels available for Mobile users
- Target our marketing efforts appropriately
  
## Task
We would like you to analyse the data and answer the following questions. 
-	What does the data suggest regarding how bookings differ by platform and region?
-	Where are we seeing the most growth? 
-	Please use any other measures that you think will be insightful. 
-	What other data or information would you request to gain additional insight?
